Exercises made for the Computer Networks exam.

In the `exercises` folder you can find all the lab lessons with the marionnet project, a file containing just the sequence of commands to execute to replicate what was done in class.

In the `workbook` folder you can find additional exercises provided by the professor that I made to practice.

In the `notes` folder you can find some useful files, such as a list of commands with their meaning or some explanations and theory-related contents.

Then just click on the name and you will be redirected to this profile page. Now you can access to the repository exactly like you would do on your computer.

To download a marionnet project, just click on the project and select the `Download raw file` option.
